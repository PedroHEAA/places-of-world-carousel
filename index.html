            <h1>Liberty State (USA)</h1>

            <p class="description">The Statue of Liberty, designed by Auguste Bartholdi (1834-1904), was a gift from
                France as a symbol of American freedom, and has watched over New York Harbor since its dedication on
                October 28, 1886. <br><br>
                There have been many claims on the internet and elsewhere that the Statue of Liberty was originally
                intended to commemorate the end of slavery in the United States following the end of the Civil War, and
                that the model for the Statue was an African American woman.</p>

            <h1>Eiffel Tower (France)</h1>

            <p class="description">It was at the 1889 Exposition Universelle, the date that marked the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution, that a great competition was launched in the Journal Officiel. <br><br>

                The first digging work started on the 26th January 1887. On the 31st March 1889, the Tower had been finished in record time – 2 years, 2 months and 5 days – and was established as a veritable technical feat. <br><br>

                The plan to build a tower 300 metres high was conceived as part of preparations for the World's Fair of 1889.
                The wager was to "study the possibility of erecting an iron tower on the Champ-de-Mars with a square base, 125 metres across and 300 metres tall". Selected from among 107 projects, it was that of Gustave Eiffel, an entrepreneur, Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier, both engineers, and Stephen Sauvestre, an architect, that was accepted.

            <h1>Tower Bridge (England)</h1>

            <p class="description">The image of Tower Bridge’s grand castle-like Towers and raising bascules make it the
                most recognised bridge in the UK, possibly even in the world. However, many confuse it with London
                Bridge. An easy mistake to make, but one we can help you with! <br><br>

                London Bridge is the oldest river crossing in London, bringing river and road traffic together. It was
                rebuilt multiple times, from timber to stone and concrete and steel. London Bridge was actually the sole
                crossing of the Thames until the construction of Putney Bridge in 1729. <br><br>

                By 1870s, around a million people were living east of London Bridge, so getting across it could take
                hours. Tower Bridge came out of this need for a new river crossing, and was completed in 1894. Its
                Neo-Gothic design was chosen to blend with the Tower of London, a request by Queen Victoria. <br><br>

            <h1>The Colosseum (Italy)</h1>

            <p class="description">The Colosseum, also named the Flavian Amphitheater, is a large amphitheater in Rome. It was built during the reign of the Flavian emperors as a gift to the Roman people. <br><br>

                Construction of the Colosseum began sometime between C.E. 70 and 72 under the emperor Vespasian. It opened nearly a decade later and was modified several times in the following years. The massive structure measured approximately 189 by 156 meters (620 by 513 feet), towered four stories high, and included eighty entrances to the amphitheater—seventy-six for the patrons, two for participants of events, and two exclusively for the emperor to use. The sheer number of entrances proved to be necessary: the Colosseum could hold more than 50,000 spectators at its maximum capacity.</p>
